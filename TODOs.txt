Near-term TODO list (before Emu3):
- Assembler
* Make sure the Screen prints and the KeyBoard reads
* Make it run at 30 fps
? Bank Registers
? Determine if GPU has VRAM bus locked (address to read indicating if GPU has VRAM bus locked)
? Frame counter (a 1/30th sec clock)
? DMA transfers
? Properly handle word read in device space (or declare that only byte reads are valid)
* Figure out why the screen in Emu2 isn't printed right. (Printing \0 isn't printing a space.)

Far-term FUTURE list (maybe never):
- Add a BCD multiply and divide
- Add a proper divide instruction
   If I interpret the value in the belt location as two other belt locations, I can get 3 args (for a price).
- If I add a scratchpad, I can have long division without that, but I'll need to use a scratchpad location like a register.
