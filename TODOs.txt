Near-term TODO list (before Emu3):
- Assembler
* Make sure the Screen prints and the KeyBoard reads
- Make it run at 30 fps
- Bank Registers
- Determine if GPU has VRAM bus locked
- DMA transfers
- Properly handle word read in device space (or declare that only byte reads are valid)

Far-term FUTURE list (maybe never):
- Add a BCD multiply and divide
- Add a proper divide instruction
   If I interpret the value in the belt location as two other belt locations, I can get 3 args (for a price).
