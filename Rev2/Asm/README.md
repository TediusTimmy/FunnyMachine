The Assembler
=============

The only difference between this assembler and the revision 1 one (besides the
different opcodes and addressing modes), is the `.def` assembler directive.

`.def sdo5 2, 0`
Define the number of arguments (2) and results (0) generated by software-
defined operation five. This is how the assembler makes sense of the fifteen
SDOs.
